MKS22X Final Project:
Our game follows the main rules of Monopoly. Users can play a 2-4 player game,
in which they can travel around the board, buy properties, and buy houses.
 They can also land on spaces where they must draw a community chest or chance card. When landing on properties owned by other players, tenants must 
pay rent. On their turn, users can see all of the details of the properties
 that they own.  New features include properly working player jail time. To
start the game, run in processing.
